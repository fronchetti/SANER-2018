(2) As a researcher in statistics, one of my main research outputs is software which implements new methodologies that I develop. I have written over 200,000 lines of code. However, in Australia, the research funding agencies do not allow funding to be used for software development. Consequently, all my software development must be justified by its role in supporting a research publication (and the journals increasingly demand that software be supplied with the paper). There is immense pressure to do no more than is necessary for a 'proof of concept' software, but I have found that the most interesting and challenging research problems only emerge when the software is developed to full maturity.

What you know today is out of date in 6 months, so you must constantly be learning.  Also what you can do changes by the month.  Especially now that packages are on GitHub and its is easy to fork and develop, what you can do in R is improving and developing so fast.  Also reproducible code and Rmarkdown is changing how people write papers and document their research.  Wow, that is really a game-changer for everyone.  People are just starting to post their Rmd files for papers, so you can immediately redo the entire analysis.

I was lucky as I got help from our IT manager for my first package (stagePop) and then I could do my second package (microPop) on my own. There are papers about both of my packages in Methods in Ecology and Evolution (Applications) and knowing I could publish a paper about the software was a big driver for me spending time on development as publications are everything in academia! Also the MEE journal publishes Applications papers free of charge and has a great impact factor so writing a package and getting it published in MEE ticks boxes for both fun (writing code!) and career progression (papers!).
The other driver is wanting to share my work and making it feel worthwhile! It's very nice when people email you and say they are finnding your package really helpful!",Helen.Kettle@bioss.ac.uk

In academia the time spent on developing solid statistical software is not valued, I.e an article has much higher value. Writing loose software (or non at all) + an article takes much less time, hence a higher article production. Which implies that you get penalized for developing solid software. 

2. In the industry I find that most mangers do not understand what it takes to write statistical software (for example at least half the time is typically spent on mathematical analysis, many seem to think you just write uml and the code) . This means that the industry typically provides very bad environments for statistical software development. Plus the industry has, in my experience, serval other issues, all meaning that the quality of the statistical software produced is low.

3. The public and some industrial managements seems to think machine learning/ statistical software can do anything. They seem completely unrealistic at times. And, importantly, forgetting to validate (or do error-prone validation of) the the machine learning system. (This is often a complicated task involving statistical and domain knowledge) The most important part of a production machine learning system is an continuous validation of the performance (the distribution of the input data is likely to change over time -- this is basic logic, but seems to be neglected or forgotten. ), a part often neglected. Meaning high risk of failure of the system, without being able to stop the system before it fails!

2) If you want to compare other researchers' methods to your own, or use others' methods, it can be very difficult to do so.  Often there is no software implementation, or the existing implementation is bad and/or poorly documented, or it requires a language/platform/environment that I'm not familiar with.
3) Working in interpreted languages like R or MATLAB, you often hit performance bottlenecks you wish you could work around.

In doing development for others, inconsistency in the structure and/or content of the data on which the software is going to be run is a major pain-point. Oftentimes, we have an example data that we are using as a development spec, but once we have completed a beta, the real data does not conform to the example data, or its format has been updated without us being informed.
2. Computational resource limitations; for some ""BIG DATA"" applications,  development on systems with modest RAM and processor resources using small sample datasets is insufficient for the intended computational task; obtaining access to the appropriate systems for development can be difficult.
3. Troubleshooting unexpected errors; we're all only human, and making large scale changes can oftentimes introduce logical errors (not true bugs, but the result is often the same).

I increasingly view R as being a valuable tool, not a language or a viable paradigm within which to develop scientific software.
